spec48.rom:

This ROM is the original one that shipped with the Spectrum 48K rubber key and 48 Plus models (PCB Issues 1 through 6A).

spec48-prototype.rom

Version of the ROM recovered from the Spectrum prototype given to Nine Tiles Inc., and currently in the posession of the Centre for Computing History. Several bugs are present, and it appears that this codebase was a continuation of the version that shipped with the Spectrum but was abandoned due to time/cost issues. It implements a more mature channel and stream handling implementation and clearly was intended to drive Microdrives directly.

spec48-beckman.rom

Swedish localisation of the Spectrum ROM for that market, allows display of Swedish characters Å, Ä and Ö, as well as fixing some ROM bugs (NMIADD handling, STR$ bug). Also has a markedly different reset sequence with coloured blocks instead of the red lines on black paper effect of the original ROM.
