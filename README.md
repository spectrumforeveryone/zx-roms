## Notes for uploaders

All non-Sinclair ROM files must be in a subfolder, even if it is just one file. There must also be an info.txt file created from [info-template.txt](info-template.txt)

Variants / updates / prototypes must have the original name and a meaningful suffix (ie. spectrum48-ninetiles). Provide full details of the ROM within the info file.
